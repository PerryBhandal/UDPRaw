UDPRaw
======

A library for constructing UDP packets from scratch and sending them over a raw socket

This library has little practical use, it was merely done for educational purposes. It was helpful in learning about UDP headers on IPv4. Once IPv6 becomes more common, I'll likely add support for it as well.
